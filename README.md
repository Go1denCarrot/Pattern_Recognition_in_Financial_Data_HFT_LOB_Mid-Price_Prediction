You are a member of a High-Frequency Trading (HFT) Hedge Fund which focuses on the
implementation of Machine Learning and Deep Learning methods for HFT Limit Order Book (LOB)
forecasting tasks. As a member of this team, your role is to provide a precise (not overly broad or
vague) and detailed research idea that will help the team to forecast LOBâ€™s mid-price movements in an
online manner (event-by-event) for profitable trading signals.



This project implements a detailed machine learning pipeline leveraging feature engineering techniques utilised in econometric analysis. All original features and new econometric 
features are then put through a feature selection process, in this case a Principal Component Analysis. The learning algorithms used will be XGBoost, Ridge Regression, Support 
Vector Regressions (SVR) (and their associated kernels), and Random Forest Regression (RFR).
